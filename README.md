# Appkiller

If you ever had to shut down some applications in repetetive cycles this application is just for you.

## Description

Appkiller is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows easy addition and sequential shutdown of various .exe files in the system. One of the main features of the application is its ability to work with exe files both through their names and through file paths, including reference paths

## Features

- **Adding .exe files:** Users can easily add .exe files by typing their entire name into the GUI.

- **Management of .exe files:** The created list of .exe files can be easily started by inbuilt .exe which will shut down all instances of the specified .exe sequentially.

- **Path handling:** The application is designed to work with paths to exe files, including reference paths, increasing flexibility in settings.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:** Simply download the repository.

2. **Running the application:** After installation, you can run the application using the command `Killer Configurator.py`.

3. **Adding .exe files:** Write "desired.exe" name and select active button within GUI and if applicable enter the path to the .exe file which will futher specify it.

4. **Management and execution:** View the list of added .exe files, where you can add, remove, and start/stop them at your convenience. After finishing click export and this will create .exe which will then shut down the application on startup of it.

   **TIP:** Specifying the path is especially usefull if you have to shut down same .exe (i.e. scripts(langs), apps) run by same program with different paths
